# eset_mac_sccm
A simple shell script to copy config file to /tmp, and then run the installer


Please put esets_remote_install.pkg and esets_setup.sh in the same folder of the script, then click install. It will first copy .sh file to /tmp, then run the installer.

If you have Apple PackageMaker, use install as the post file, then you can have a custom ESET installer
